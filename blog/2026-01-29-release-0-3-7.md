## Overview

:white_check_mark: TyKO 0.3.7 is the first version tested with Typesense 30.x+.  
:sos: If you're using **DocSearch Scraper** check the Compatibility Matrix below!

:::danger
As of Typesense version `30.0`, breaking changes were introduced in the API for transferring the synonyms and curation sets that created a compatibility issue with DocSearch Scraper version prior to `0.12.0.rc14`. For that reason, it is advised to upgrade Typesense and DocSearch Scraper simultaneously if you are upgrading to Typesense 30.x+ from earlier major versions.

**Compatibility Matrix:**

| Typesense | DocSearch Scraper |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 29.x      | 0.11.0            |
| 30.x+     | 0.12.0.rc14+      |
