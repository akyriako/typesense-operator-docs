# FAQ

### How can I contribute to TyKO?

There are a bunch of options:

* If you have found a bug, issue or you want to request a feature, reach out to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akyriako/typesense-operator).
* If you feel like contributing to the code, just fork the repo and get yourself started. Everybody is welcome.
* If you are using TyKO in production, it would be great if you added your organization in the [Adopters](adopters) list.
* If none of the above is really your jam but you still like TyKO, give a star to the repository.

### Why was my feature request not implemented?

TyKO is a vanilla (yet opinionated) way to deploy highly-available, self-healing Typesense clusters on Kubernetes (of any kind and flavor).
And that's all it aims to deliver. Your feature request might have not been implemented because:

* was diverting from the objective of just managing the lifecycle of the cluster itself and nothing more,
* was rather a corner-case of your own landscape that needed individual adjusting (we try to keep it vanilla),
* there is not enough time for everything. You are welcome to fork and bounce back with a pull request.

### Why was my pull request not accepted?

TyKO is a vanilla (yet opinionated) way to deploy highly-available, self-healing Typesense clusters on Kubernetes (of any kind and flavor).
And that's all it aims to deliver. Your pull request might have not been accepted because:

* was diverting from the objective of just managing the lifecycle of the cluster itself and nothing more,
* was rather a corner-case of your own landscape that needed individual adjusting (we try to keep it vanilla),
* something was off (code quality, oversimplicity or overcomplexity of the solution, overall understanding -or lack of it- of the code base).

### Is there any Slack or Discord channel for support?

No, there isn't and is not going to be one in the future. We respond relatively fast to GitHub issues and discussions and so far works fine for everyone.

### Is TyKO still in beta?

No. TyKO, after version 0.3.0, is a very stable release suitable for production workloads.

### Son of a gun, I lost my data (aaaargh!)

Kindly review the [Disclaimer](/docs/getting-started#disclaimer) carefully once more. (aaaargh!!!)

### What font sorcery is this?

It's [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), the opensource typeface by JetBrains.

### Where did you dig up the landing page illustrations from?

Illustrations are from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/).

### Can we meet Tyko, the mascot?

Nope-that can't do, he's a very busy fella!
