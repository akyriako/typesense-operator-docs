# Getting Started

The Typesense Kubernetes Operator (TyKO) is designed to manage the deployment and lifecycle of Typesense clusters within Kubernetes environments. The operator is developed in [Go](https://go.dev/) using [Operator SDK Framework](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/), an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

    **Tyko** is the archaic Finnish form of the Danish name **Tyge**, which itself comes from the Old Norse name **Tóki**. Tóki was originally a hypocoristic of names built on the Norse god’s name **Þórr** (“Thor”) combined with **ketill** (“cauldron”).

    Because its root names invoke Thor, Tyko carries connotations of strength, thunder and protection in Scandinavian lore, and is often referred to as the “little thunder”.

## Key Features

Key features of Typesense Kubernetes Operator include:

1. **Custom Resource Management**: Provides a Kubernetes-native interface to define and manage Typesense cluster configurations using a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) named `TypesenseCluster`.

2. **Typesense Lifecycle Automation**: Simplifies deploying, scaling, and managing Typesense clusters.
  
    It handles aspects as:
     - bootstrapping Typesense's Admin API Key creation as a `Secret`.
     - deploying Typesense as a `StatefulSet`, each `Pod` consists of two containers:
       - the *Typesense node* itself based on the image provided in the specs,
       - the *Typesense node metrics exporter* (as a sidecar), based on the image provided in the `spec.metricsSpec`.
     - provisioning Typesense services (a headless & a discovery `Service`),
     - actively discovering and updating Typesense's nodes list (quorum configuration mounted as `ConfigMap`).
     - placing claims for Typesense `PersistentVolumes`.
     - *optionally* exposing Typesense API endpoint via an `Ingress`.
     - *optionally* provisioning one or multiple instances (one per target URL) of **DocSearch** as `Cronjobs`.
     - *optionally* provisioning [Prometheus targets](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/multi-target-exporter/) for the `Pod` metrics via a `PodMonitor`.
  
3. **Raft Quorum Configuration & Recovery Automation**:
   - Continuous active (re)discovery of the quorum configuration reacting to changes in `ReplicaSet` **without the need of an additional sidecar container**,
   - Automatic recovery of a cluster that has lost quorum **without the need of manual intervention**.
